# Credit-risk-classification

Overview
This project aims to analyse various Machiine Learning Techniques to train and evaluate the performance of a model based on loan risk. The models were trained using different methods and their performance were compared to determine the better-perfoming mdel.

Process
Machine Learning model 1 was built by instantiating a logistic regression model and training with the original training sets, fitting it to the training sets and using it to generate predictions.
Machine Learning model 2 was created by resampling the original training data using the random over sampler module, instantiating a logistic regression model and fitting the resampled training sets to the model and generating predictions

Result
Based on the analysis, it is found Model 2 is better than Model 1 in predicting high risk loans and has higher accuracy in both labels. I would recommend using model 2 in identifying high rish loans and has better accuracy in predicting labels.
